Proverbs 10:15 A rich man's wealth is his strong city;
the poverty of the poor is their ruin.

* The Text
** A rich man's wealth gives him confidence.
  - Having riches makes him feel secure.
  - He feels like his riches can defend him against anything.
** The sense of confidence they give is false.
  - (18:??) A rich man's wealth is his strong tower and like a high wall in his imagination.
  - Actually, (Proverbs 11:4) "riches do not profit in the day of wrath".
  - No amount of riches can guard from death and definetly from God.
** When the poor trust in wealth it becomes their ruin.
   - But we broke ones are not off the hook: we can trust in wealth even when we don't have it.
  - If we trust in riches and and do not have it we feel defenceless. Like a city in ruins.

* Application

  - The point is when we trust in other things instead of God we feel secure when we have them but in ruin when we do not.
  - This goes for riches but also anything else that we look to for security that is not God.

  - An if we feel like we are "ruined" after losing something that might just be a sign that it was our strong city.

  - When we are confidence when things are going well feel shaken when things are going well, this is a sign we are trusting in what we have instead of trusting in God.
  - There are many things we may be tempted to trust in instead of God: wealth, ability, approval and recognition of people.
  - Trust God.
