  <h3 id="subtitle">Proverbs 10:15</h3>
  <blockquote>
    A rich man's wealth is his strong city;<br>
    the poverty of the poor is their ruin. 
  </blockquote>
    
  <h3>The Text</h3>
  
  <p>
    This proverb shows the perspective of a person who is trusting in his wealth.
    This goes for rich and poor.
    In reality, a rich man's wealth is not a strong city. It cannot actually help him but he thinks it can. His riches make him feel secure.
    Solomon does not endorse trusting in riches. He says in (11:4) "riches do not profit in the day of wrath".
    Conversely, when the poor trust in riches poverty becomes their ruin. They trust in riches but do not have it so are stripped of their defence.
  </p>
  <h3>Application</h3>
  <p>
    The point is if we trust in other things instead of God we feel as secure as in a strong city when we have them but in ruin when we do not.
    This goes for trusting in riches but also anything else that we find security in except God.
    The poor are not automatically off of the hook because they do not have riches. 
    If we feel like we are in "ruin" that may be a sign to us that we have been trusting in riches.
    When we lose confidence and feel shaken when things are going well, this is a sign we are trusting in what we have instead of trusting in God.
    There are many things we may be tempted to trust in instead of God: wealth, ability, approval and recognition of people.
    Trust God.
