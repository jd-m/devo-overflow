<h2>Types</h2><ul><li>short devotions on bible verse related to a subject</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Ideas</h2><h3>Do not worry about tomorrow</h3>
<h3>Don't discipline with scorpions</h3>
<h3>Misreacting</h3>
<h3>Eccelesiastes 12: Weighing and arranging with great care</h3>
<h3>Teaching the Truth</h3>
<h3>Consistency: why it is important and why it is so hard</h3>
<h3>The illusion of omnipotence</h3>
<h3>Teaching as Sons of the Most High: send the rain on the just and the unjust</h3>
<h3>Keeping in step with the Spirit</h3>
<h3>Entropy: tendency to chaos</h3>
<h3>Teaching for the students</h3>
<h3>Good relationships != people pleasing</h3>
<h3>Don't feel like a very good Christian (teacher)</h3>

<h3>Posts</h3><ul><li>What does is mean to teach as a Christian?
<ul><li>What is a teacher?
<ul><li>A teacher is not someone who imparts information, but someone who helps another learn. There is a difference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is a Christian?
<ul><li>A Christian is someone who has acknowledged that they are a sinner hopelessly in need of saving, and who trusts in Jesus to save them, and now lives to make Him, and His message of eternal life through Him, known.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So what is a Christian teacher?
<ul><li>Display Christ in character - first thing people see - not faking it, but genuinely as God has changed us.</li>
<li>Display Christ in life - the life we live outside of school has been impacted by Jesus - the things we do and focus on, and our reasons why - relationships we have.</li>
<li>Share the gospel - this is the best news we should share it whenever we get opportunity - this is the core of our belief and our inderstanding of who we are and how we live - Apprehension: in our country it is ok to talk about faith, many people don't, but we should, in fact I think more people want to than we think.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Posts</h2><h3>Intro post: vision</h3><ul><li>What is a Teacher?</li>

<li>What is a Christian?</li>

<li>How would a Christian teach?

<ul><li>Teaching as unto the Lord

<ul><li>The students are important and we do our best for them, but they are not the ones I am trying to please most. It is the Lord I am trying to please.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<h3>Getting ready for the new year</h3><ul><li>Expectations for students (and yourself!)

<ul><li>Start as I mean to go on

<ul><li>Start off on the right foot</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Routines</li>

<li>Upfront investment - it is worth it in the long run

<ul><li>Take a genuine interest -</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The amount of time wasted because students get into bad habits is ridiculous. It really is.

<ul><li>Be honest/humble about what you will be able to do

<ul><li>Don't over-promise</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Build routine and get into good habits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
