#+TODO: idea notes draft revise proof | done 
* Devotions
** proof One thing You Lack
** idea John 5:39 Don't miss Jesus
   - You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life.
   - What challenged me about this was that the scribes and Pharisees were reading the scriptures and they were seeking eternal life.
   - We can be reading the bible trying to find out how best to live life, but if we miss Jesus we have missed the point.
   - This goes for trying to read the bible as a set of instructions.
   - This goes for study or devotion. If I am asking God to help understand and obey His without Jesus I am missing it.
** idea Joy and Service
   - Joy is found in serving Jesus
   - The reason we are unhappy or unfilfilled sometimes is becuase we are not doing what we are supposed to be doing.
     - Isn't it enought to know Jesus to be satisfied.
     - Yes. But God gives us desires that he intends for us to have met.
       - Basic ones: food, warmth.
       - Relational ones: friendship, parent-child relationship.
       - Likewise God gives us a desire for work and service.
         - Namely serving Jesus.
       - That probably sounds unintelligible to non-believers.
       - That may sound awkward to believers.
       - But experience suggests we are most self-forgetful, and are enjoying our lives the most when we do work for Jesus.
** Christian Love
   - If you love those who love you, what good is that to you.

** idea Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of His beast

** idea The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life

** idea Whoever works His land will have plenty of bread

** idea This blessing has Fallen Upon Me
   - Obedience is a blessing from God.
   - It is something we look back on.
   - The blessing is past tense.
   - We cannot know whether we will be obedient until it is tested.

** idea Foolish talk ends as evil madness

** notes Eccelesiastes 7:8 Better is the end
   - Better is the end of a thing than the beginning.
   - This goes for smaller things: thinking about what to do to bring the best outcome in a situation, rather than just what we are thinking in the moment is wisdom. A patient person thinks of the end. An angry person does what they feel and only thinks on the beginning.
   - It is more wisdom to live with the end in mind than the beginning
   - This may make us sorrowful, or seem sombre. It may make people think we are morbid. But if we live in light of the end we will change the way we live today.
   - Jesus encourages us to think on the end.
     - Mt: Save life - lose it. Lose life (for His sake) - save it. When He will appear with His angels in the glory of the Father.
