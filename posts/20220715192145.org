Why read a blog about living out the Christian faith as a teacher? If you are a Christian I hope you find something helpful, if you are not I hope you get to see the teaching profession from a different perspective.

Teachers wear many hats: Communicators of knowledge, role models, authorities, carers. Many of us do these things in some way.

I will be looking at what the bible has to say about how to teach and what a teacher should be. Also some thing teaching has taught me.
