<blockquote>
<p>A rich man's wealth is his strong city;
the poverty of the poor is their ruin.
</p>

<p>Proverbs 10:15 (ESV)
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The strong city of the rich</h2><p>The text does not mean that the rich man's wealth actually is a strong city, just that he thinks it is. He trusts in what he owns. His wealth is like a high wall in his imagination (Proverbs 18:11). His riches and possessions are his power and he feels like they can defend him against anything.
</p>

<h2>The poverty of the poor</h2><p>If we aren't rich it would be easy to think this does not apply to us, but the next line says does not let us off so easily. Just because the poor have little it does not mean they are off of the hook, because we can trust in wealth even when we don't have it. If we trust in stuff to keep us safe and don't have any, what will happen? We will fell weak, helpless and defenceless. Poverty will feeling like being in a ruin.
</p>

<h2>Secure in Christ not stuff</h2><p>If we find security in things, we will feel secure and at peace when we have them but defenceless when we don't. There are a lot of things we can run to for security: money, possessions, achievement, approval. The list is long. But ultimately they will let us down. They are like the broken staff that when we lean on it it breaks and pierces our hand.
</p>

<p>So maybe if something we lose something, or something fails us, and that shakes us, that just my be a sign we were putting our confidence in the something we shouldn't. It might just be a sign we were making is our strong city. And this can happen for Christians too. We can feel secure and in favour with the Lord when things are going well, but when they aren't we can feel like He's abandoned us. 
</p>

<p>But Jesus is not like that. When we trust in Him, He does not let us down. This may seem hard to do when other things appear to be more immediate. When I am worried about my future, I can see my bank account. I can't see Jesus right now. So may we take God at His word when he says that His name is a strong tower (Proverbs 18:10) and none of those who take refuge in him will be put to shame (Psalm 34:22).
