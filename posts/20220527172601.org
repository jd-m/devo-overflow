  A rich man's wealth is his strong city;
  the poverty of the poor is their ruin.

  Proverbs 10:15 (ESV)
  #+end_quote



  The text does not mean that the rich man's wealth actually is a strong city, just that he thinks it is. His wealth is like a high wall in his imagination (Proverbs 18:11). The rich man in Proverbs is a man who trusts in what he own. His riches and possessions are his power and he feels like they can defend him against anything.

  But just because the poor are not rich does not mean they are off the hook, because we can trust in wealth even when we don't have it. If we trust in wealth, but do not have it, we will fell weak, helpless and defenceless. Our poverty will like feel like ruin.

  The point is that if we find security apart from God we will feel secure when we have them but defenceless when we do not. On the flipside, if we feel like we are ruined because of something we lack that might just be a sign that we were making it our strong city.

  There are a lot of things we can be tempted to find security in: money, possessions, success, people's approval and more. But ultimately they will let us down. But Jesus will not ever let us down. His name is a strong tower. If we find our help in Him, we are safe (Proverbs 18:10).
