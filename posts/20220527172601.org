#+DESCRIPTION: Relying on wealth - the perspective of a 'have' and 'have not'
#+SNIPPET: On the surface this verse seems to say what a lot of people would see as a basic fact: being rich makes you secure because it means whatever you need you can get it. But is that all scripture is really saying?

#+begin_quote
A rich man's wealth is his strong city;

the poverty of the poor is their ruin.

/Proverbs 10:15 (ESV)/

* The City of the Rich
  On the surface this verse seems to say what a lot of people would see as a basic fact: /being rich makes you secure because it means you can get whatever you need to keep secure/. But is that what scripture is really saying? I don't think so. Before thinking about what it is saying, here's what I think it is not saying. It is /not/ saying that a rich man's wealth actually is a strong city, just that he /thinks/ it is. The proverbial rich man trusts in what he owns. His wealth is like a high wall in his imagination (Proverbs 18:11). His riches and possessions are his power and he feels like they can defend him against anything.

* The Poverty of the Poor
  If we aren't rich it would be easy to think this text doesn't apply to us, but the next line doesn't let us off so easily, because we can trust in stuff even when we don't have much. And if we trust in things to keep us safe but don't have much, what will happen? We will feel helpless, defenceless and weak. This is why for the poor man who thinks he needs riches to be secure, being in poverty feels living in a ruin.

* Secure in Christ not stuff
  The point is that if we find security in things, we will feel secure when we have them but defenceless when we don't. There are a lot of things we can run to for security: money, possessions, achievement, approval, appearance. The list goes on. But if we rely on these things, ultimately, they will let us down. Relying on these things is like being injured and leaning on a broken crutch for support. They will break when we put our weight on them and will leave us even more hurt than we already were.

* Trust Check
  And I think this verse also gives us a way check what we are trusting in; if we rely on something, it lets us down and we are shaken more than we thought we would be that might be a sign that we were putting more confidence in it than we thought. And we can do this even as Christians. As believers we can root our confidence in (1) our /circumstance/ or (2) our /performance/ instead of in Jesus.

** Circumstance
   If I feel secure when life is good and things are going well, but when they aren't I'm shaken, then maybe what I thought was trust in God was actually confidence in my circumstance.

** Performance
   Or if I feel solid in my faith while I'm consistent in my spiritual disciplines but then I miss a day or two and think God's not happy with me anymore that might just mean I've been trusting in my own performance instead of in Christ. Should I read my bible and pray every day? Absolutely. But I don't trust in my consistency I trust in Jesus. I trust in Him because of his faithfulness and because on the cross he dealt with my sin once and for all.

* Real Refuge
  If we base our security in what we have, or what we can do we will eventually be let down. But Jesus doesn't fail us. And though he is hidden from our sight now, He is more of a real refuge than anything we can see with our eyes. We can see our bank account, we can see people, and when things get tough it may seem easier to trust in them. But may we take God at His word when he says that His name is a strong tower (Proverbs 18:10) and none of those who take refuge in him will be put to shame (Psalm 34:22).
