21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

This is Jesus' rich man who was confident in his own righteousness comes to him asking what he must do to inherit eternal life.

- looking at him - Jesus response to this man was not general but specific to him.

- loved him - what he said was out of love for him. 

- You lack one thing - Jesus was looking at what he lacked and wanted him to have, not what he had and wanted him to lose. 

- Give away the thing you desire most: Jesus picked on the thing that feared losing the most. This was what his heart desired and trusted in more than God, and to prove that Jesus challenges him to give it up.

- You will have something better and longer lasting: 

When Jesus calls us to give things up he does not look at what we will lose, but what we will gain.
