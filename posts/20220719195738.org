21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”

  This is Jesus' response rich man who was confident in his own righteousness and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life.

Jesus cuts straight through reveals to him and to us what is going on in his heart. He calls the man to give up his possessions and follow Him, and his reluctance to do it shows he loved his stuff more than God.

His love for his stuff stopped him from having relationship with God and in love Jesus calls him out.

As believers there will be things Jesus calls us to leave behind so we can have better walk with God.

A few things to keep in mind when Jesus calls us to give things up:

- He is intentional
- He does it out of love
- He wants us to gain
- He wants better for us
- The thing we want to lose the least may be the thing we need to give up the most.

/He looked at him/ - Jesus response to this man with intent. Jesus was listening to what this man ws saying so we know his response was not thoughtless but specific to the need of this man.

/He loved him/ When Jesus tells this man to give up what he has it is out of love.

As believers we are called to give things up. Some things it is obvious need to go, but some things actually we would like to hold on to, and we would be worried if we felt like God called us to give it up.

/You lack one thing/ Jesus was looking at what this man lacked and what he wanted him to have, not what he had and wanted him to lose.

- /You will have treasure in heaven/ 

When Jesus calls us to give things up he does not look at what we will lose, but what we will gain.

- Give away the thing you desire most: Jesus picked on the thing that feared losing the most. This was what his heart desired and trusted in more than God, and to prove that Jesus challenges him to give it up.
