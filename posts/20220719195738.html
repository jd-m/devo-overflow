<blockquote>
<p>21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The setup: Sometimes we have too much</h2><p>This is Jesus' response rich man who was confident in his own righteousness comes to him asking what he must do to inherit eternal life.
Jesus cuts straight through the man and reveals to him and to us what is going on in his heart. He calls him to give up his money, because his love for what he has was getting in the way of his love for God.
As believers we have things in our lives that Jesus will call us to give up that hold us back from having a fuller love for God.
I believe this text shows us a few things about Jesus heart in calling us to give things up:
</p>

<h2></h2><p><em>He looked at him</em> - Jesus response to this man with intent. Jesus was listening to what this man ws saying so we know his response was not thoughtless but specific to the need of this man.
</p>

<p><em>He loved him</em> When Jesus tells this man to give up what he has it is out of love.
</p>

<p>As believers we are called to give things up. Some things it is obvious need to go, but some things actually we would like to hold on to, and we would be worried if we felt like God called us to give it up.
</p>

<p><em>You lack one thing</em> Jesus was looking at what this man lacked and what he wanted him to have, not what he had and wanted him to lose.
</p>

<ul><li><em>You will have treasure in heaven</em></li>
</ul>

<p>When Jesus calls us to give things up he does not look at what we will lose, but what we will gain.
</p>

<ul><li>Give away the thing you desire most: Jesus picked on the thing that feared losing the most. This was what his heart desired and trusted in more than God, and to prove that Jesus challenges him to give it up.</li>
</ul>
