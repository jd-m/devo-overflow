<h2>A Contradiction?</h2><p>Receiving generously. It sounds like a contradiction in terms. We show generosity when we give, not receive. But that is exactly how Scripture tells us the early church lived. Acts 2:46 tells us "day by day, [they were] attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes", and they "<b>received their food with glad and generous hearts</b>". What is the connection between generosity and recieving, and what does it mean to receive a generous heart?
</p>

<h2>Self-centred giving</h2><p>  Before looking at generosity in receiving, let's look at generosity in giving. There are different kinds of giving. One kind is self-centred. This is the kind the Pharisees showed when they gave an offering that was big, but didn't really put a dent in their bank accounts (Luke 21:1-4). They gave out of their abundance. They assessed what they had and decided what they were be able to give and still be comfortable. When I give in this way, 
I see my possessions as my own and feel their main purpose is to cover my needs and wants. Anything that makes me go beyond this makes me uncomfortable. The heart behind self-centred giving make self and comfort the measure of what it is willing to give. 
</p>

<h2>God-centred giving</h2><p>In contrast to this is a God-centred giving. The heart behind this kind of giving acknowledges that all things belong to God, and that what I have is not my own, but His. And because of that I want use what I have in a way that pleases Him. This often means using it to meet the needs of others. And because this kind of generosity acknowledges that all things are from God, it does not set limits on what it will give.
</p>

<p>This is the kind of giving we see in the early church where "all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> "And there was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need." <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> This is what real generosity looks like in giving. <em>True generosity is not so much giving what we have, but rather acknowledging that what we have is not ours, but God's.</em>
</p>

<h2>Generosity in receiving</h2><p>But the church showed this attitude of generosity not only in giving but also recieving. How does this work? Think of it this way: when I realise that everything we have is from God, and that no one really has a claim on anything, then I become willing not only to give but to receive, because whatever I receive is ultimately a gift from the Lord. This is what is means to receive with a generous heart. It means to receive with a heart that acknowledges everything we have as a gift from God, and as a result is ready to both give and receive generously.
</p>

<p>Paradoxically then, willingness to receive can be a test of whether our generosity is self-centred or God-centred. Because if I am not willing to receive that's probably because I'm projecting my self-centred view of possession on to you. I see my possessions as my own and I don't want you to touch them, so I see your possessions as your own that you wouldn't want me to touch. It's like a negatively motivated golden rule: <em>Don't receive from others what you wouldn't want to give to them.</em> So then what looks like not wanting to burden others can actually be pride, which comes from a self-centred view of possessions, and allowing people bless you can be a sign of God-centred generosity.
</p>

<p>As a caveat, I don't mean we should act as if ownership does not exist and justify taking things from others "because well, all things are from God". That's stealing. What I mean is that we should not count things as our own, because what know that everything we have is from God. And it should follow that when others have this heart and seek to bless us, we should not be too proud to receive from them. That is, unless we are too proud to receive from God. But if we are too proud to receive from God, we may as well stop breathing because every breath is from Him.
