<div><p>Yesterday I went to the Hope Explored session on peace and something that came up was How Jesus greets His disciples after He is raised from the dead.
</p>

<p>These disciples were had abandoned him, and had let him down, but says to them "Peace, be with you". Jesus speaks peace to them because they are at peace with Him despite their failure. What a word of hope to us who also fall short of the Lord and let Him down. He does not meet us with words of condemnation or rebuke, but peace. He bought the peace we have with God and Himself with His blood on the cross.
</p>

<p>Compare this to the chief priests and Judas. Judas also let Jesus down, and when he goes to the chief priests to find atonement, forgiveness and peace, he is told "See to it yourself, what is that to us".
</p>

<p>See to it yourself: He finds no help to carry his burden which is too much for him. He finds no pardon. He has no peace. And his distress is so great he ends his own life.
</p>

<p>What is that to us? They take no responsibility for his sin, even though they encouraged him to do it. Compare this to Jesus who was betrayed who the people rejected, who carried the sins of those who rejected and failed him, when he had no guilt himself.
